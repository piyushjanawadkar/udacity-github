When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when there are multiple collaborators. When you code from different machines. When you want to share you work with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

To prevent changes in the process of development being overwritten by an (possibly updated) copy in the remote repository.
