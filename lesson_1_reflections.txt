How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It focused attention on only the lines that changed, drastically reducing the number of lines to analyze for finding the bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

- helps finding which version introduced a bug.
- helps me commit code in small units.
- I can look at the history to find where I left the work.
- Helps find why a particular change was made.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
